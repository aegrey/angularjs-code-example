#### Notes
Comments throughout specify areas of the application I did not build out in the way I would an enterprise application, and compare to understand differences. Important to pay attention to code style & keep up with best practices (I prefer https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md).
